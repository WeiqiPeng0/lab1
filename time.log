I discussed my solution with: Zhiyu Liang, Haipeng Li, Shuao Zhang


The first obstacle I mete is understanding the structure of the whole project. It is rather abstract to think
the video recommendation service as a independent service. I spent some at at this before starting the 
assignment. I looked at several examples on the gRPC official tutorial and ends up understand the service
better. Debugginig is of course difficult because we are only provided two simple examples. It is challenging
to come up with ways to test fallback, retries etc. Another point is to implement the Mock server. I am blind
at how it was used intially. After reading a post in Ed I know that the mock server is actually a kind of dependency
injection. I am glad that I can learn such practical design skills.
