Dial() is similar to the connect() socket API.

There are certain types of connection errors that should not be retried. For example, when the request is unauthorized (error 401) or the method is not allowed (error 405). Retrying regardless of the types of error is inefficient.

I would prefer setting a threshold below which we shall deliver the expired response. If the response has been outdated too much, it is inappropriate to display those recommendations to user level. 

The tradeoff is that raising an error might have negative impact on user experience, while stale response won't effect the smoothness of the service, given that the service is able to fully recover soon.

We can somehow increase the RPC timeouts. We can also add more retries after a back-off period.

I might trade-off the RPC timeout time to wait for responses that are slow when the query load is high. Retries can be combined with distributed service providers, so that we send query to another service provider address.
